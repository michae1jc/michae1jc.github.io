From my recent conversation I learned that there seems to be a lot of pre-assumptions about traveling in Latin America. Before I visited Japan in August 2024, there was a huge warning about possible earthquakes in the area; I did not know whether or not I should go. My friend laughed at me "You'd go to Mexico and Colombia."

I guess he has a point. Granted, Mexico and Colombia are dangerous. Perhaps more so than an earthquake warning. But they're also some of the most welcoming and most beautiful countries I've been to. The average person around me seem to have heard so much about traveling in Latin America that they don't intend to visit these places. I'm writing to try to change that. 

Of course, I'm not going to argue that these places are the safest places in the world. They're not. Having grown up in China, where guns and drugs are banned and security cameras are everywhere, Latin America seems to me the exact opposite; but I contend that it won't be as bad as one might think, just as long as you know what you're doing.
